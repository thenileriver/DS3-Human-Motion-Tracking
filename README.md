# DS3-Human-Motion-Tracking

This project was done as a part of UCSD's Data Science Student Society (DS3) Project Cohort Winter 23.

The goal of this project was to create a model that could track human movement in real time, and output that movement in a standardized format through stick figure animation. This project was selected to be showcased at HDSI's student project showcase, where more than 100 students, professors, industry partners and members of the public tried our live demo of capturing their movement.

The final project was done using a ResNet 101 architecture in a coordinate based output. Our initial attempt was done using a U-Net architecture in a confidecne map based output.

All the work was done by working remotely using UCSD's SuperComputer Center. We unfortunately lost some files due to our cluster getting accidentally deleted by an admin halfway through the project, which is also why we changed our architecture of the project mid-way.
